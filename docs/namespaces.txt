We let namspaces get a bit overboard. Namespaces are for loosely
grouping objects and preventing object name collisions. They
should not be used to over classify sources or to define directory
or common library structures.

Also we let the case of the VCC namespace change and we have 
namespaces the use either VCC:: or vcc::  This gains nothing
but confusion.  I see two choices here. a) go all lowercase or 
b) use CamelCase.  Since we previously had CamelCase I decided
to return to it.

After applying CamelCase there is now the following:

VCC::			   // Any VCC object
VCC::Core          // VCC core objects
VCC::UI            // VCC user interface objects
VCC::Util          // VCC utility objects
VCC::Debugger      // Coco Debugger objects
VCC::Debugger::UI  // Coco Debugger UI objects
VCC::Device		   // VCC device objects

I used 'sed -i' modify all namespaces to this standard.  If CamelCase
causes much heartburn it is simple to use sed to make them all
lowercase.  If done properly renaming the namespaces should cause
no effect on compiled code.
